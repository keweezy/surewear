                After weeks of searching the internet and trying to navigate all
                the restrictions on purchases and returns for my daughter's
                First Communion dress, we made an appointment at SureWear
                Boutique. What a delightful experience. First impression ~ the
                variety and number of styles to chose from was amazing. Staff
                was so helpful guiding us through the choice and selecting
                several different styles that Chika liked. The staff was to quick to
                realize what Chika favored and brought in several dresses. What a
                joy for a father to see Chika say, "This is it! I'm saying
                yes!" Thank you for your expertise, your professionalism, your
                patience, and your personal attention. We highly recommend your
                beautiful boutique.
